Hamlet: To be, or not to be- that is the question: 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- 
No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation 
Devoutly to be wish'd.

           [[B]]        
There is a girl in New York CIty
                                       [[A]]
Who calls herself the human trampoline
    [[C#m]]
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
 
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
[[B]]
Oh, so this is what she means.
                              [[E]]
She means we're bouncing into Graceland.
 
And I see losing love
                         [[A]]
Is like a window in your heart:
                      [[C#m]]        
Everybody sees you're blown apart
          [[B]]            
Everybody feels the wind blow.
