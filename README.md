Lightweight Slide Projector/Viewer

This lightweight slide viewer is built with Javascript/HTML/CSS.
It has been built and tested using the Chrome browser.

It allows you to select a local text file from a 'director' page and display it as slides in a viewer screen

Slides are seperated in the text file by two carraige returns.

The viewer will attempt to work out the maximum possible font size based on the size of the browser window being used.

The viewer allows guitar chords to be inserted to the text file- these will be displayed in a panel with fingering patterns
